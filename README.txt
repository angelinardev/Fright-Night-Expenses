This program allows you to successfully run an expenses program. You can add events, have items in those events who each have their own price and names, and you get calculate the total price for an event. You can even calculate the total price accross all events on file, and display all events. Everything you do in this program is saved to file, so if you make changes in one session, they will remain when you next open this program.

This program is not installed. It is run from the command line. From the program's root directory run the following:

python main.py

This code requires no additional libraries, they are all already built in, other than the program's custom modules, which are already included.
